                        Bitcoin (Core) (BTC) is the sole group responsible for development on BTC's client.  In the past, lack of a diversified development team
                        and node implementation, have caused bugs to become a part of the protocol.  BCH currently has  one mining full-node implementation
                        (Bitcoin Cash Node).  This implementation is a forked version of the Bitcoin (Core) reference client, which means it may share the same
                        (undiscovered) bugs.  With a diverse network of nodes, bugs in the implementation of the protocol will result in incompatible blocks,
                        causing a temporary fork.  This situation is healthy for the network in the long term, as the temporary forks will resolve over time,
                        with the intended implementation becoming the consensus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin Verde is a ground-up implementation of the Bitcoin (Cash) protocol.  This primary function of this project is to be a unique
                        java implementaion of a BCH full node to diversify the BCH network's implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin Verde is a full node, blockchain explorer, library, SPV wallet, electrum server, and stratum server, with a mining pool in
                        active development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the reference client, Bitcoin Verde stores most of the blockchain within a traditional SQL database.  The SQL database
                        allows for tracking multiple BCH forks/orphans and enables insightful queries to be run within the entire history of Bitcoin--for
                        instance, via a query, Bitcoin Verde can report the ratio of P2PKH vs P2SH outputs, or easily report the number of transactions added
                        to the network per period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin Verde tracks and syncs forks; it determines the <i>head</i> blockchain by respecting the chain with the most Proof of Work
                        (with a compatible ruleset). Forked/Orphaned blockchains may be visualized within the explorer.  Forked blocks are stored as
                        BlockchainSegments.  These segments are stored as a Nested Set, allowing efficient queries to determine relationship among one another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unconfirmed Transactions are stored with referential integrity to their spent inputs and are inserted when they are received (assuming
                        validity and its dependant outputs have been stored).  In this sense, Bitcoin Verde has an unlimited mempool size, since transactions are
                        written to disk.  Transactions attempting to spend outputs that have not yet been received are stored in a separate table until their
                        dependent transactions have been received; in theory, this is also of unlimited size but is limited in order to prevent resource exhaustion
                        attacks.  Stored transactions respect the first-seen principle and not inserted into the database unless provided within a mined block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TransactionOutput addresses are indexed as transactions are received.  This functionality is required for the Explorer to be able to
                        query the balance of addresses.  With addresses indexed, it is possible to instantly sync SPV wallets in the future, once privacy concerns
                        have been addressed and the protocol is expanded to support this functionality.  As of Bitcoin Verde v2.2.0, an the node is compatible with
                        the Electrum protocol, allowing Bitcoin Verde nodes to serve as Electrum Cash Wallet servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reorgs are handled slightly differently than the reference client.  Since all forked blocks are tracked and validated, and a full ledger is
                        maintained (not just the UTXO set as in the reference client), switching to a new fork is a trivial process and does not require a reorg
                        at all in order to validate new transactions.  However, when mining, the existing mempool must be cleaned up during a reorg.  This mempool
                        reorg is handled by undoing the abandoned blocks and reapplying the blocks within the new head chain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nodes are also tracked within the database.  In this way, Bitcoin Verde can report on the distribution of node versions and supported features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blocks and Transactions may be trimmed from Bitcoin Verde once they are spent.  With trimming enabled, spent Blocks, Transactions, and
                        TransactionOutputs are deleted from the database and disk once they are sufficiently old.  With this feature enabled, the Node is no longer
                        considered a Full Node as it loses the ability to serve historic blocks.  Additionally, the Explorer fails to display blocks that have been
                        pruned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All functionality, including networking, within Bitcoin Verde is multi-threaded.  The multithreaded nature of Bitcoin Verde should allow the
                        node process, validate, and relay more transactions per second than the reference client; furthermore, Bitcoin Verde's unlimited mempool size
                        should help to mitigate some problems encountered during past stress-tests on the network.  These claims are hypothetical, and will be proven
                        (or disproven) during the next network stress-test.

                            Enabling SSL/TLS for the Block Explorer can be done by providing a certificate key and certificate to the explorer configuration.  To generate a

                        <p>
                            By default, the Block Explorer runs on port 8080.  When hosting the Block Explorer for the public, either a reverse proxy routing port 80 to internal 8080 can be used, or the server can be configured to route 80 to 8080 via iptables.
                            On linux, the <tt>forward-ports.sh</tt> script in the <tt>scripts</tt> directory can be run as root to configure iptables to handle this routing.  Changes made to iptables are not permanent and will be lost on restart, so it may be
                            useful to configure this command to run on startup.

                                Security is always a vital consideration when hosting any application. Security is a cost-benefit scale between ease of use and risk. Risk is a combination of the consequence of compromise, the scale of the vulnerability, and the
                                value incentive to an attacker.  The Bitcoin Verde node and explorer do not currently hold or manage private keys which reduces the consequence of an improperly configured server, however the value any server has to an attacked is
                                never zero.  Exposing any server to the public internet always creates a target for attacks.  For this reason, Bitcoin Verde should never be run as root.  Never expose bitcoin private keys (or other sensitive information) to a
                                publicly exposed server running the Bitcoin Verde Block Explorer.

                        Most of the node's operations are asychronous.  The primary asynchronous services are the <tt>BlockDownloader</tt>, <tt>BlockHeaderDownloader</tt>, <tt>BlockchainBuilder</tt>,
                        <tt>AddressProcessor</tt>, <tt>TransactionDownloader</tt>, and <tt>TransactionProcessor</tt>.  These various services alongside the <tt>NodeManager</tt> and the
                        <tt>JsonRpcSocketServerHandler</tt> comprise the majority of the node's functionality.  Events from one service often trigger other services to wake up; for instance,
                        completing a block download from within the <tt>BlockDownloader</tt> triggers the <tt>BlockchainBuilder</tt> to check for available blocks to process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three steps are taken when a block hash or header is received: the hash is queued for download within the <tt>pending_blocks</tt> table, the <tt>node_block_inventory</tt>
                        table is updated to keep a record of which node(s) can be used to download the block, and the BlockDownloader is woken up.  The <tt>BlockDownloader</tt>
                        queries <tt>pending_blocks</tt> for any blocks that have not been downloaded; when a match is found, the <tt>BlockDownloader</tt> checks the <tt>NodeManager</tt> for
                        nodes that have the block inventory, and requests the block.  If there are blocks that can't be downloaded because there are no peers connected that have announced that block,
                        then a <tt>BlockFinder</tt> message is broadcasted and the pending block hashes are deleted from <tt>pending_blocks</tt>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a block is downloaded, the <tt>BlockchainDownloader</tt> is woken up.  If there is a block that has been downloaded that has its parent block processed, the
                        <tt>BlockchainBuilder</tt> stores and validates the block.  The <tt>BlockchainBuilder</tt> continues to process blocks until it runs out of available blocks; once complete,
                        a <tt>BlockFinder</tt> message is broadcast to all peers to ensure there are no new blocks available before the service goes back to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <tt>AddressProcessor</tt> is woken up when a new block has been stored and validated.  The <tt>AddressProcessor</tt> iterates through each TransactionOutput to index
                        Addresses for the Block Explorer.  When blockTrimming is enabled, the <tt>AddressProcessor</tt> is disabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly to how blocks are queued for download, when a new transaction is announced its hash is queued into <tt>pending_transactions</tt>. The <tt>TransactionDownloader</tt>,
                        <tt>TransactionProcessor</tt> share the same relationship and life-cycles as the <tt>BlockDownloader</tt> and <tt>BlockchainBuilder</tt>.
                    </p>

                        Bitcoin Verde's database is a self contained MariaDB database.  The database is started when the node starts and is shut down when the node shuts down.  If the node crashes,
                        the database is not always shut down with it and lives as a zombie process; in this state, the node will fail to restart until the database is killed manually (usually via
                        a kill command).
